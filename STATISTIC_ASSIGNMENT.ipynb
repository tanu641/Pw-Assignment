        "A random variable quantifies the outcome of a random experiment. Discrete random variables take countable values, and their probability distribution is represented by a probability mass function. In contrast, continuous random variables take any value within a given range, and their distribution is represented by a probability density function. Both types are essential in modeling real-world phenomena and are fundamental to probability theory and statistics.\n",

        "The high correlation of 0.994 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between hours studied and test scores. This suggests that, in this dataset, as the number of hours studied increases, the test scores increase in a nearly linear fashion.\n",

        "Conclusion\n",
        "The covariance indicates the direction of the relationship (positive), but it doesn't provide information about the strength of the relationship.\n",
        "The correlation gives a standardized measure of the strength of the linear relationship between the variables, and in this case, it shows a very strong positive relationship between hours studied and test scores.\n",
