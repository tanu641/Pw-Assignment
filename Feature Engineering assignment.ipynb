    "\n",
    "#     Feature scaling is the process of standardizing or normalizing the range of independent variables (features)\n",
    "#     in a dataset. The goal is to transform the features so that they all contribute equally to the model, without\n",

    "#1.   Improves Convergence in Gradient-Based Algorithms >>> \n",
    "#     Many machine learning algorithms (e.g., Gradient Descent) are sensitive to the scale of the input features.\n",
    "#     If features have vastly different ranges, the gradient descent optimization process might converge more slowly\n",
    "#     because it needs to adjust weights at different rates for each feature.\n",
    "#     Scaling features helps the model converge faster because all features are on the same scale.\n",

    "#     measuring distances between data points. If the features are not scaled, features with larger ranges will \n",

    "#3.   Improved Model Performance >>> \n",
    "#     Some algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) may also benefit from scaling, as it can lead \n",
