        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "This refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also involves restricting access to certain components of an object, typically using access modifiers like private, protected, or public, which helps protect the object's internal state from outside interference and misuse.\n",
        "Example: A Car class might encapsulate the car's speed and methods to change the speed (e.g., accelerate(), brake()).\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        " *Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features or functionalities of an object. It allows users to interact with objects at a high level without needing to understand their internal workings.*\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, instance methods and class methods are both types of methods that belong to a class, but they differ in how they are accessed and what they operate on.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Instance Methods\n",
        "Definition: Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python classes. They are associated with an instance (or object) of the class. These methods can access and modify the instance's attributes (data).\n",
        "Access: They take self as their first parameter, which refers to the specific instance of the class that calls the method. This allows instance methods to access the instance’s attributes and perform operations specific to that instance.\n",

        "Example of an Instance Method:\n",

        "# Example usage\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
        "my_car.display_info()  # This calls the instance method on the object 'my_car'\n",
        "In the above example, display_info is an instance method because it operates on the instance of the Car class and accesses instance attributes (self.make, self.model, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Class Methods\n",
        "Definition: Class methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than the instance. These methods can access and modify class-level data (i.e., data shared across all instances of the class).\n",
        "Access: Class methods take cls as their first parameter, which refers to the class itself, not a specific instance. This allows class methods to work with class-level attributes.\n",
        "Usage: Class methods are used for operations that are related to the class as a whole rather than a specific instance.\n",
        "Example of a Class Method:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    number_of_cars = 0  # Class-level attribute\n",

        "# Example usage\n",
        "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",
        "car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2021)\n",
        "\n",
        "Car.get_car_count()  # This calls the class method on the class 'Car'\n",
        "In this example, get_car_count is a class method because it operates on class-level data (Car.number_of_cars) and takes cls as its first argument, referring to the class itself rather than an instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Differences:\n",
        "Instance Method:\n",
        "Takes self as the first parameter (refers to the instance).\n",

        "Can access both instance and class variables.\n",
        "Class Method:\n",
        "Takes cls as the first parameter (refers to the class).\n",
        "Operates on class-level data, shared across all instances.\n",
        "Can be called on the class itself, without needing an instance.\n",
        "In summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance methods are for working with specific instances of a class.\n",
        "Class methods are for working with class-level data or performing operations that are relevant to the class itself.\n",

        " How does Python implement method overloading? Give an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "   \n",
        "ANS<<<\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading like some other programming languages (such as Java or C++), where you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or numbers of parameters. Instead, Python uses default arguments and variable-length arguments to achieve similar behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you can define a single method that can handle different numbers or types of arguments by using:\n",
        "\n",
        "Default Arguments (providing default values for parameters).\n",
        "Variable-Length Arguments (*args for non-keyword arguments and **kwargs for keyword arguments).\n",
        "1. Using Default Arguments for Method Overloading:\n",
        "You can simulate method overloading by defining default values for function parameters. This way, the function can be called with varying numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    # Method with default arguments\n",
        "    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):\n",
        "        return a + b + c\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example usage\n",
        "calc = Calculator()\n",
        "print(calc.add(5))      # Output: 5 (only 'a' is passed, 'b' and 'c' use defaults)\n",
        "print(calc.add(5, 3))   # Output: 8 (only 'b' is passed, 'c' uses default)\n",
        "print(calc.add(5, 3, 2)) # Output: 10 (all arguments passed)\n",
        "In the above example, the add method can be called with one, two, or three arguments. The second and third arguments (b and c) have default values of 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Using Variable-Length Arguments (*args):\n",
        "With *args, you can pass a variable number of positional arguments to a method, allowing the method to handle different numbers of arguments dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    # Method with variable-length arguments\n",
        "    def add(self, *args):\n",
        "        return sum(args)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example usage\n",
        "calc = Calculator()\n",
        "print(calc.add(5))           # Output: 5 (one argument)\n",
        "print(calc.add(5, 3))        # Output: 8 (two arguments)\n",
        "print(calc.add(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10 (four arguments)\n",
        "In this example, the add method can take any number of arguments and returns the sum of all of them. The *args syntax collects all the positional arguments into a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Using Keyword Arguments (**kwargs):\n",
        "If you want to accept a variable number of keyword arguments, you can use **kwargs. This allows you to pass key-value pairs as arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def greet(self, **kwargs):\n",
        "        if \"name\" in kwargs:\n",
        "            print(f\"Hello, {kwargs['name']}!\")\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            print(\"Hello, stranger!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example usage\n",
        "person = Person()\n",
        "person.greet(name=\"Alice\")   # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
        "person.greet()               # Output: Hello, stranger!\n",
        "In this example, **kwargs allows for a variable number of named arguments, and the method responds differently depending on whether the name argument is provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Python doesn't directly support traditional method overloading.\n",
        "Instead, method overloading is achieved by using default arguments, *args, and **kwargs.\n",
        "Default arguments allow you to provide optional parameters.\n",
        "*args allows the method to accept a variable number of positional arguments.\n",
        "**kwargs allows the method to accept a variable number of keyword arguments.\n",
        "Through these techniques, you can design functions that behave differently depending on the number and type of arguments passed, achieving similar flexibility to method overloading.\n",

        "Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance\n",
